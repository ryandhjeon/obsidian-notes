#HeterogeneousGraph #Recommendation #LinkPrediction 

### Introduction

### Goal

Improve the recommendation performance in HIN

### Challenges

1. Meta-path based similarities rely on explicit path reachability, and may not be reliable to be used for recommendation when path connections are sparse or noisy.
2. Meta-path based similarities mainly characterize semantic relations defined over HINs, and may not be directly applicable to recommender systems

### Previous works

1. Path based similarities [1] or latent factors [2], which cannot learn the complicated mapping mechanism of HIN information for recommendation


### Idea

1. Learn effective heterogeneous network representations for summarizing important structural characteristics and properties of HINs.
2.
