**INTRODUCTION**

The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has affected human lives at all levels. Maps visualizing this pandemic have become a valuable tool for public to retrieve and under- stand the situation in their areas of interest.

In Monmonier ([1996](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42489-020-00057-w#ref-CR14 "Monmonier M (1996) How to lie with maps. Am Stat. 
https://doi.org/10.2307/2685420")), cartographic principles are discussed and how maps can be used and misused is illustrated. In Monmonier ([1996](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42489-020-00057-w#ref-CR14 "Monmonier M (1996) How to lie with maps. Am Stat. 
https://doi.org/10.2307/2685420")) and Campbell and Shin ([2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42489-020-00057-w#ref-CR4 "Campbell JE, Shin M (2011) Essentials of geographic information systems; Saylor Academy: Washington, DC, USA,

absolute numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases were used for differently sized US states with varying population. To make the COVID-19 cases comparable, one has to normalize them against the total population. A widely used rate is cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Then, comparisons are meaningful, even in less populated states or regions.

In addition to the irritating absolute numbers, Fig. [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42489-020-00057-w#Fig4) is illustrated with red colors, which is known to be able to cause anxiety, fear or danger on the map reader’s side. So, this is an inappropriate choropleth map representation for the map content related to a pandemic, which is an unpleasant topic by itself. Slocum et al. ([2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42489-020-00057-w#ref-CR21 "Slocum TA, McMaster RB, Kessler FC, Howard HH (2009) Thematic cartography and geovisualization, 3rd edn. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River")) present examples of appropriate choropleth maps and could be consulted for best practice examples.

2.2 Misleading Maps

[States Are Reopening With No Clear Picture of U.S. Coronavirus Cases]
- Changes in testing capacity, reporting discrepancies around fatalities, and overall differences in methodologies have made interpreting data a challenge, especially when trying to compare one geographic region or time period to another.

[The need for GIScience in mapping COVID-19]
- Securing geo-located health data at a high enough spatial resolution to detect meaningful patterns has proven challenging due to privacy constraints

- Whatever the method of collection, the increase of higher resolution and dynamic geo-located data on COVID-19 can allow researchers to go beyond the simple maps of present to tell a much bigger, more detailed story.
