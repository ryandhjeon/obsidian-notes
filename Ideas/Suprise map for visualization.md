**INTRODUCTION**

The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has affected human lives at all levels. Maps visualizing this pandemic have become a valuable tool for public to retrieve and under- stand the situation in their areas of interest.

2.2 Misleading Maps

[States Are Reopening With No Clear Picture of U.S. Coronavirus Cases]
- Changes in testing capacity, reporting discrepancies around fatalities, and overall differences in methodologies have made interpreting data a challenge, especially when trying to compare one geographic region or time period to another.

[The need for GIScience in mapping COVID-19]
- Securing geo-located health data at a high enough spatial resolution to detect meaningful patterns has proven challenging due to privacy constraints

- Whatever the method of collection, the increase of higher resolution and dynamic geo-located data on COVID-19 can allow researchers to go beyond the simple maps of present to tell a much bigger, more detailed story.
