# Beam search
- Beam search isÂ **a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set**. Beam search is an optimization of best-first search that reduces its memory requirements.
- It is very popular because, although it requires more computation, it usually produces much better results.
