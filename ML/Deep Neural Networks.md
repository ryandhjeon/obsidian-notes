[[Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks]]
- Uses gradient decent with backpropagation to learn a complicated computation well.

*Limitation*
- DNN's input and outputs encoded with vectors of <u>fixed dimensionallity</u>
- The length of input and output could be different in `sequential data` problem; `Speech recognition` or `Translation`
