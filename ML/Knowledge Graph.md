1. (Discontinued) **OpenCyc**: a curated knowledge graph of common-sense knowledge implemented from the Cyc knowledge base 
2. (Discontinued) **Freebase**: a KG built as a crowdsourced effort using structured data from a number sources including Wikipedia schemes and contributions
3. [**WikiData**](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page): a free, collaborative project build on top of wiki contents, additionally providing metadata about data provenance 
4. [**DBpedia**](https://www.dbpedia.org): a knowledge graph built by automatically extracting pairs of key-values from the Wikipedia infoboxes, which are then mapped to the DBpedia ontology with crowdsourcing;
5. [**YAGO**](https://github.com/yago-naga/yago3): a large KG which maps facts from WikiData, GeoNames and other data sources to a taxonomy build by combining WordNet and Wikipedia categories
6. [**ConceptNet**](http://conceptnet.io/): a free, crowdsourced linguistic KG including information from WordNet, Wikipedia, DBpedia and OpenCyc
7. [**WordNet**](https://wordnet.princeton.edu): a curated lexical database of relationships between concepts (hypernyms, pertainyms, meronyms etc.). We refer to its RDF version of 2014, WordNet3.1RDF.
8. Google’s and Facebook’s Knowledge Graph
9. Amazon’s and Ebay’s Product Graphs
10. KGs domain ontologies without assertions, e.g. schema.org

Note: some of the above resources have been discontinued
