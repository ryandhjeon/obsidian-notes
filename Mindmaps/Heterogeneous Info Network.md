Heterogeneous Information Network
- Problem: Sparse data, Cold start
	- Collaborative filtering algorithms
		- Auxiliary information
			- Structured auxiliary information
			- Unstructured auxiliary information
				- Many methods came out, but only related to specific types of auxiliary information, and not universal.

- Many methods model them as homogeneous networks, ignoring the heterogeneity of objects and links
	- Concept: Heterogeneous Information Networks (Shi et al., 2016a)
