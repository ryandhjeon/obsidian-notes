### Abstract

```
Artificial intelligence powered by deep neural networks has reached a level of complexity where it can be difficult or impossible to express how a model makes its decisions. This black-box problem is especially concerning when the model makes decisions with consequences for human well-being. In response, an emerging field called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to increase the interpretability, fairness, and transparency of machine learning. In this paper, we describe how cognitive psychologists can make contributions to XAI. The human mind is also a black box, and cognitive psychologists have over 150 years of experience modeling it through experimentation. We ought to translate the methods and rigor of cognitive psychology to the study of artificial black boxes in the service of explainability. We provide a review of XAI for psychologists, arguing that current methods possess a blind spot that can be complemented by the experimental cognitive tradition. We also provide a framework for research in XAI, highlight exemplary cases of experimentation within XAI inspired by psychological science, and provide a tutorial on experimenting with machines. We end by noting the advantages of an experimental approach and invite other psychologists to conduct research in this exciting new field.

### INTRODUCTION

- Black box problem: Impossible to explain the model's decision
- XAI: the promise of AI at scale + urgent lack of satisfying explanations for AI decision making.
- Advance an XAI known as Artificial Cognition (Ritter et al., 2017): tradition of experimentation developed within cognitive psychology. 
- Draw parallels between the black-box in XAI and epistemic challenge faced by cognitive psychologists.
- Contribution from Psychology is low on XAI
