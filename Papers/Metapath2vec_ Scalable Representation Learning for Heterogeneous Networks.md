### Abstract

```
We study the problem of representation learning in heterogeneous networks. Its unique challenges come from the existence of mul- tiple types of nodes and links, which limit the feasibility of the conventional network embedding techniques. We develop two scalable representation learning models, namely metapath2vec and metapath2vec++. The metapath2vec model formalizes meta-path- based random walks to construct the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node and then leverages a heterogeneous skip-gram model to perform node embeddings. The metapath2vec++ model further enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and semantic cor- relations in heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments show that metapath2vec and metapath2vec++ are able to not only outper- form state-of-the-art embedding models in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as node classification, clustering, and similarity search, but also discern the structural and semantic cor- relations between diverse network objects.
