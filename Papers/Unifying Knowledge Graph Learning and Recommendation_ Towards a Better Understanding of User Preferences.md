The author proposes a Translation-based User Preference model (TUP) that incorporates the strengths of Knowledge Graph (KG) learning. This aims to decipher the concealed associations between users and items, thus reflecting the nuanced patterns of user behavior. Initially, these preferences manifest as latent vectors, offering limited semantic transparency. To address this, the author strategically aligns these preferences with the relations extant in the KG, thereby endowing them with explicit semantic context. This alignment aligns seamlessly with the intuitive understanding that the attributes of an item significantly steer a user's decision-making process. The advanced instantiation of the model, referred to as Knowledge-enhanced TUP (KTUP), orchestrates a simultaneous learning of representations for users, items, entities, and relations, thereby offering a comprehensive schema of the interactions. Nonetheless, even with the noticeable performance improvement, the KGE regularization falls short in its capacity for in-depth reasoning. To effectively encapsulate long-range connectivities and to produce interpretable outcomes for high-order modeling, an explicit model is necessitated that adeptly navigates the complexities of long-range relations.
