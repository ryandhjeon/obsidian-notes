[[Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks]]
- DNN's input and outputs encoded with vectors of fixed dimensionallity
- Can solve the issue, by using multiple LSTMs. Each LSTM can read the input sequence, one timestep at a time, and use another LSTM to extract the output sequence from that vector.
